# Module 4 Project

## Description

Are you up for a challenge that will put your skills to the test? Degen Gaming ðŸŽ®, a renowned game studio, has approached you to create a unique token that can reward players and take their game to the next level. You have been tasked with creating a token that can be earned by players in their game and then exchanged for rewards in their in-game store. A smart step towards increasing player loyalty and retention ðŸ§ 

To support their ambitious plans, Degen Gaming has selected the Avalanche blockchain, a leading blockchain platform for web3 gaming projects, to create a fast and low-fee token. With these tokens, players can not only purchase items in the store, but also trade them with other players, providing endless possibilities for growthðŸ“ˆ
